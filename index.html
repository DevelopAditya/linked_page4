<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler was fanatically interested in the youth of the country. 
He felt that a strong Nazi society could be established only by teaching children Nazi ideology. This 
required a control over the child both inside and outside school. What happened in schools under Nazism? 
All schools were cleansed and purified. This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as politically unreliable 
were dismissed. Children were first segregated: Germans and Jews could not sit together or play together. 
Subsequently, undesirable children  Jews,  the physically handicapped, Gypsies  were thrown out of schools. 
And finally in the 1940s, they were taken to the gas chambers.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Good German children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling, 
a prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks were rewritten. Racial science was introduced to 
justify Nazi ideas of race. Stereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes. Children were 
taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worship Hitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a 
spirit of violence and aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could make children iron hearted, 
strong and masculine.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Youth organisations were made responsible for educating German youth 
in the the spirit of National Socialism. Ten-year-olds had to enter Jungvolk.  At 14, all boys had to join the 
Nazi youth organisation  Hitler Youth  where they learnt to worship war, glorify aggression and violence, condemn 
democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies and all those categorised as undesirable. After a period of rigorous 
ideological and physical training they joined the Labour Service, usually at the age of 18. Then they had to serve 
in the armed forces and enter one of the Nazi organisations.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>The Youth League of the Nazis was founded in 1922. Four years later it 
was renamed Hitler Youth. To unify the youth movement under Nazi control, all other youth organisations were systematically 
dissolved and finally banned.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2>The Nazi Cult of Motherhood</h2></u></i></font><br> 
<image src="6.jpg" height=300 width=500 align=left>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Children in Nazi Germany were repeatedly told that women were radically 
different from men. The fight for equal rights for men and women that had become part of democratic struggles 
everywhere was wrong and it would destroy society. While boys were taught to be aggressive, masculine and steel 
hearted, girls were told that they had to become good mothers and rear pure-blooded Aryan children. Girls had to 
maintain the purity of the race, distance themselves from Jews, look after the home, and teach their children Nazi 
values. They had to be the bearers of the Aryan culture and race.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>In 1933 Hitler said: In my state the mother is the most important citizen. 
But in Nazi Germany all mothers were not treated equally. Women who bore racially undesirable children were punished 
and those who produced racially desirable children were awarded. They were given favoured treatment in hospitals and 
were also entitled to concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway fares. To encourage women to produce many 
children, Honour Crosses were awarded. A bronze cross was given for four children, silver for six and gold for eight or 
more.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>All Aryan women who deviated from the prescribed code of conduct were publicly 
condemned, and severely punished. Those who maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were paraded through the town 
with shaved heads, blackened faces and placards hanging around their necks announcing I have sullied the honour of the nation. 
Many received jail sentences and lost civic honour as well as their husbands and families for this criminal offence.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2> The Art of Propaganda</h2></u></i></font><br>
<image src="7.jpg" height=350 width=300 align=right>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>The Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to great effect. 
The terms they coined to describe their various practices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never used the 
words kill or murder in their official communications. Mass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the 
Jews), euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. Evacuation meant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you 
know what the gas chambers were called? They were labelled disinfection-areas, and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake 
showerheads.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Media was carefully used to win support for the regime and popularise its worldview. 
Nazi ideas were spread through visual images, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters, groups identified 
as the enemies of Germans were stereotyped, mocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were represented as weak 
and degenerate. They were attacked as malicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create hatred for Jews. The most 
infamous film was The Eternal Jew. Orthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked. They were shown with flowing beards wearing kaftans, 
whereas in reality it was difficult to distinguish German Jews by their outward appearance because they were a highly assimilated 
community. They were referred to as vermin, rats and pests. Their movements were compared to those of rodents. Nazism worked on the 
minds of the people, tapped their emotions, and turned their hatred and anger at those marked as undesirable.</p></font><br>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>The Nazis made equal efforts to appeal to all the different sections of the population. 
They sought to win their support by suggesting that Nazis alone could solve all their problems.</p></font><br>
